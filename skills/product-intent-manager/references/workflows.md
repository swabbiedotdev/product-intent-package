# Workflows

Use the workflow that matches the request. In every mode, maintain only the
artifacts needed for this product and keep tasks, analysis, implementation
evidence, and review results outside the PIP.

In every mode, write the resulting PIP as present-tense product facts or
timeless requirements, not as an account of changes or a list of work. See
[end-state wording](product-intent-package-standard.md#write-the-end-state-not-the-change).

In every authoring mode, apply
[diagram-first product logic](product-intent-package-standard.md#diagram-first-product-logic):
inspect affected prose and YAML for hidden rules, gates, and recovery behavior;
put them in the owning diagram before removing duplicate narrative. Keep exact
inputs and outcomes, references, and current product meaning. Do not invent new
behavior to fill a branch or migrate unrelated packages without authorization.
Proportionality means fewer focused diagrams, not prose-only consequential logic.

Apply [Process-connected logic](product-intent-package-standard.md#process-connected-logic-no-orphan-rules)
in every authoring and review mode. Start from documented process triggers and
outcomes; keep local rules at their application steps and extract shared logic
only with explicit consuming calls and result handling. Do not add standalone
rules for possible future use. For an existing orphan, establish its intended
application or resolve the gap without inventing behavior or silently deleting
the requirement.

In every authoring mode, apply
[Capability modules](product-intent-package-standard.md#capability-modules).
All product logic is module-owned, including user experience, shared
infrastructure, data rules, quality policies, and orchestration. Keep one root
product record and context-only architecture; do not propose a parallel root
workflow, sequence, data, quality, or normative experience layer. A small PIP
can have one module and a small number of files. Pilot boundaries and real
consumers to sequence an authorized migration, not as the final ownership scope.
Do not change product behavior or implementation topology as a side effect of
moving PIP records. During scoped updates or audits, use
[Module-bounded review](change-and-handoff.md#module-bounded-review) rather than
recursively reading every linked module. Full-package requests retain their
requested scope.

## Create

1. Copy the module-first template from `assets/product-intent-template/`.
   Rename `modules/primary-capability/` to the product's actual initial capability.
2. In `product.yaml`, set format `7.0.0`, product name, release, outcome,
   boundary, actors, capabilities, exclusions, measures, and optional product-
   wide DCL.
3. Put observable outcomes in their diagrams. Keep `product.yaml` minimal;
   use `assets/acceptance-template.yaml` only for unique cases that cannot be
   meaningfully diagrammed, explaining why and keeping the case in its module.
   Do not copy diagrammed behavior.
4. Draft the physical product boundary in `architecture/stack-context.md` and
   actor-visible paths inside the owning module's `experience/user-flows.md`.
5. Add state, data, sequence, rule, contract, journey, screen, quality, or
   deployment artifacts only when each adds distinct meaning. Every rule,
   workflow, schema, and constraint belongs inside its responsible module;
   optional root views contain only topology, context, and owner links.
6. Add concise current rationale in the diagram file that owns every non-
   obvious choice.
7. Apply the skill-level checks in
   [PIP Use and Alignment Checks](change-and-handoff.md). Do not store their
   result or add status, readiness, signoff, or handoff content to the PIP.

Determine where current PIP editing authority is defined. Copy
`assets/governance-template.yaml` when agents or contributors need a durable
way to verify edit requesters. Include at least one full product leader and only
real, verifiable organizational identities; do not ship placeholder entries.
Omit the file when current repository or project guidance already makes
editing authority unambiguous.

## Reconstruct

Use reconstruction when a product exists but its intent is missing, incomplete,
or inconsistent. Do not use the canonical PIP as the research workspace.

1. Create an isolated PIP fork and separate working notes.
2. Identify the product and release being reconstructed, the authorities who
   can choose and adopt its complete end state, source environments, and known
   boundary. Do not blend several
   implementations into one implied end state.
3. Inspect only useful evidence: running surfaces, documents, research, designs,
   routes, behavior, tests, data, contracts, integrations, operations, incidents,
   and migrations.
4. In the working notes, distinguish direct observations, inferences,
   contradictions, recommendations, and source limitations.
5. Reconstruct from the outside inward: actors and visible flows, capabilities
   and acceptance, physical stack, then only the state, data, sequence, rule,
   contract, quality, or journey detail needed to resolve product meaning.
6. Ask a product authority whose scope covers the choice whether each
   consequential behavior is intended, a defect, a legacy constraint, a
   different future product, or out of scope.
7. Express the resulting coherent end state in the fork without evidence
   labels, questions, alternatives, or proposal fields.
8. Adopt the fork through an editor whose authority covers the complete change
   and the normal Git workflow. Until then, the canonical PIP remains unchanged.

Before assigning DCL, establish current user interactions, whether users wait,
failure consequences, acceptable interruption and recovery, credible load,
risk, and operating needs. Do not infer DCL from company stage or implementation
complexity. Before expanding the design for a rare or complex edge case the PIP
does not resolve, ask a human product authority whether it should be automatic,
routed to safe manual review or recovery, failed or deferred visibly, or
excluded from the release. Do not infer that choice from DCL.
For a manual fallback, define the smallest monitored notification that makes the
responsible admin aware and provides enough incident context. Add dedicated
admin controls only when the approved response cannot use existing tools or its
frequency, urgency, or volume justifies them.

## Complete

For an incomplete canonical package:

1. Read root product context, physical architecture, and the module owners and
   dependencies relevant to the requested completion scope.
2. Check whether a reader can identify the release outcome, boundary, actors,
   capabilities, visible experience, physical ownership, observable acceptance,
   and material constraints.
3. Follow direct links and inspect obvious semantic dependents; do not build an
   exhaustive graph.
4. Add or repair only the facts and artifacts needed to close a real ambiguity.
5. Move diagrammable acceptance logic into its diagram owner; retain textual
   acceptance only for qualifying non-diagrammable cases, not mere convenience.
6. Add or refresh current rationale without preserving obsolete history.
7. Remove empty, duplicative, implementation-only, status, readiness, review,
   and other ceremonial content after preserving current intent in its owner.
8. Apply the skill-level checks without creating a PIP check record.

If completion exposes a product choice, keep the canonical PIP unchanged for
that choice and resolve it outside the package. Use a PIP fork when a concrete
alternative needs review.

## Update

If the request already gives an unambiguous new end state, first verify that the
requester's current editing authority covers the complete coherent change.
Then update the owning canonical facts and affected dependents through the
team's normal Git workflow. If authority is insufficient or the change is still
a recommendation, alternative, or unresolved choice, create an isolated PIP
fork instead.

1. Identify the owning fact, affected actors and capabilities, and release.
2. Use module-bounded review where public boundaries exist; otherwise review
   direct links plus obvious semantic dependents.
3. Update the owner, then affected flows, behavior, data, architecture,
   sequences, constraints, and acceptance.
4. Refresh each affected diagram's current rationale so it contains all and
   only the reasons for the new current design.
5. Preserve stable cross-file IDs when meaning is unchanged. Add or retire IDs
   only when meaning is added, split, replaced, or removed.
6. Apply the skill-level checks. Let Git preserve the change history.

Do not place both old and new intent in the canonical PIP, add a proposal lane,
or increment per-artifact versions for an ordinary change.

## Implement or audit against a PIP

Use this workflow only when implementation or audit is explicitly governed by
a PIP:

1. Record the task-start canonical PIP Git revision and release in the existing
   task or working notes, not in the PIP.
2. In an implementation ticket, link directly to relevant PIP records and keep
   only execution boundaries, code anchors, order, tips, hazards, blockers,
   progress, and proportional verification. Do not restate product behavior,
   acceptance, constraints, diagram logic, data rules, or design targets.
3. For an audit, use tickets to identify the requested implementation scope,
   affected code, and relevant PIP links. Derive audit criteria from the
   canonical PIP owners, not from ticket wording, checklists, or status. Follow
   direct links and obvious semantic dependents needed to judge that scope.
4. Treat code, migrations, tests, tickets, logs, and runtime behavior as
   implementation evidence. They do not change product intent. A ticket may
   narrow execution scope but cannot revise the PIP.
5. Compare planned or observed product-significant behavior, schema, policy,
   queries, and design with the task-start PIP and any later direct instruction
   from a verified authority whose scope covers the complete change.
6. Inspect existing implementation owners before adding code. Follow sequence
   ownership and verify input provenance. Reuse or modify suitable existing
   code rather than creating a parallel owner; keep that construction plan in
   external implementation notes, not in the PIP.
7. Follow exact linked mockups. Use compatible example or export code when
   available, without silently changing surfaces, components, states, or
   interactions.
8. Proceed with ordinary internal choices that stay inside current behavior and
   material constraints.
9. Report implementation-to-PIP deviations in the task or audit result, and
   report ticket-to-PIP drift separately. Fix the implementation toward the PIP
   when authorized. Do not edit the canonical PIP merely to document what the
   ticket or implementation currently says or does.
10. If the team wants the implementation difference to become product intent,
   create a coherent PIP fork for review by an authority whose scope covers the
   complete change. Adopt it only after that product decision.

When useful, compare the PIP's default or overridden target DCL with an observed
implementation DCL in the audit notes. Never persist the implementation level
or comparison in the PIP.

## Simplify or migrate an older package

For a format-6 or similarly heavy package:

1. Identify the current product facts and acceptance outcomes before removing
   machinery. Keep evidence, proposals, open questions, implementation findings,
   and history in working notes if they still matter operationally.
2. Move minimal release context, outcome, boundary, actors, capabilities,
   exclusions, measures, and optional default DCL into `product.yaml`.
3. Remove package and item statuses, readiness labels, signatures, confirmation
   metadata, handoff records, implementation observations, proposal lanes,
   source catalogs, and routine decision history from the canonical PIP.
4. When edit-request authority needs to be explicit, replace older governance
   machinery with the minimal current `full`, `scoped`, and `proposal_only`
   access policy. Remove decisions, approval or signoff records, precedence and
   supersession histories, confirmation metadata, and ordinary change history.
   Omit governance only when current repository or project guidance already
   makes editing authority unambiguous.
5. Preserve acceptance meaning in the diagrams before removing redundant YAML.
   Keep acceptance beside its module owner or in module-local `acceptance.yaml`
   only for unique cases that cannot be meaningfully diagrammed; explain why.
6. Consolidate context/component/container views into stack context, screen maps
   into module-owned user flows, and conceptual/persisted relationships into
   module-owned data views when those facts remain needed. Assign all shared
   logic and cross-module workflows to responsible modules; keep one full
   entity definition with linked projections rather than a root catch-all ERD.
7. Replace scoped target/PIP/implementation DCL comparisons with one optional
   product default and narrow current-intent overrides. Move implementation
   comparisons to audit notes.
8. Add concise current rationale to each diagram owner and remove historical
   narration.
9. Remove artifact indexes, trace graphs, coverage matrices, change logs,
   readiness ledgers, discretion registries, empty placeholders, package hashes,
   and duplicated metadata.
10. Preserve meaningful cross-file IDs, direct links, and product behavior.
    Check the result proportionally.

Do not chase parity with the old file count. A representation-only migration
must not silently change product meaning.
